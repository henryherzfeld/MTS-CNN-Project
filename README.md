# MTS-CNN-Project
Baseball Project

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) on footage of pitches from a baseball video game to classify image data into two classes: ball or strike. This repository 
contains notebooks and scripts that use different neural network frameworks to try to perform this task. The "Results" folder contains spreadsheets which report the accuracy of 
these models on each fold of the test set during each run of the model using 10 fold cross validation.
